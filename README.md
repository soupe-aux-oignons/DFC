# Detection Face Cropper

In this project we will use different models and libraries in python to code a face detection and automatic cropper tool.
The final aim is to have an automatic tool for facial detection and recognition in large batches of images.

As of writing two versions are available for testing and refining : an openCV version, and an MTCNN using Tensorflow version.
All folders contain the main program (test.py), two test pictures and a folder with ten faces of former french president Jacques Chirac.
